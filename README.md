assignment_2
==============================

This project is assignment 2 of the MDSI (Master of Data Science and 
Innovation) degree, subject ADSI (Advanced Data Science for Innovation), at 
UTS. There are two parts to this project; 
1. Modelling: this constitutes cleaning the data, applying tranformations and 
fitting a model, including all the hyperparameter tuning.
   
2. Deployment: Creating a docker image and deploying the image to Heroku

Modelling
-------------
All model artefacts are saved into the `/models` directory. Each of the 
experimental models will have a prefix, e.g. `2_pytorch`. The best 
performing model will be duplicated and named `model`. Accordingly, the other
artefacts that support `model` will be named `pipeline.sav` and 
`label_encoder.sav`.

Deployment
-------------
The deployment is done using a Dockerfile, which is sent to Heroku.
